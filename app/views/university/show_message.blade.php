        <p>A work breakdown structure is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into
            manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines the work
            breakdown structure as a "deliverable oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be
            executed by the project team." The work breakdown structure visually defines the scope into
            manageable chunks that a project team can understand, as each level of the work breakdown
            structure provides further definition and detail.
            Figure 1(below) depicts a sample work breakdown structure with three levels defined.</p>
