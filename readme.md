TEAMLAND
========

Currently, work platforms exist in groups, assignments and embodiments thereof. These platforms allow us to create group projects, adding members, allowing the assignment of tasks and provide evidence of compliance with these, however, none of these platforms is aimed at the student / teacher interaction in universities, referring specifically to project management software.

For the reasons mentioned above, born TeamLand, it will be a web platform oriented project management software among students and teachers in universities.

One of the main features that provide TeamLand, will introduce students to the management and implementation of concepts such as homework assignments, taking into account time management, allocation of roles and an equitable distribution of work, as well as lists Post, among others.

In addition, some of the features that allow TeamLand facing the teacher or tutor is the ability to continuously monitor the team members to assess their performance and development over the course of the project.
